		<h2>What is it?</h2>
                <p><strong>ownCloud</strong>: ownCloud is open source software that you install on your computer to provide anytime, anywhere access to your files via mobile devices, desktop sync clients and web browsers. ownCloud is managed by you, entirely within your control, allowing you access to files on your storage, no strings attached. Provided in an easy to install virtual appliance (or as bits to be installed and configured), ownCloud can be up and running on your computer in 3 easy steps: <a href="/install">download the virtual appliance</a>, import it into your preferred hypervisor, and boot.</p>
                <p><strong>ownCloud Proxy</strong>: Simply put, ownCloud Proxy enables you to take a laptop and an Internet connection, connect to your privately hosted ownCloud from anywhere, without requiring you to make any changes to your local network settings – no router configuration, no DNS entries, no domain name registration. The ownCloud Proxy service relies on a partner who provides the service for a fee. Right now, there is one partner, <a href="https://pagekite.net/" target="_blank">pageKite</a>. More are coming!</p>

		<h2>How does it work?</h2>
		<p>ownCloud Proxy is both an app inside ownCloud and a service. The ownCloud Proxy app is installed in ownCloud and configured in the ownCloud admin panel. From the ownCloud Proxy app, an admin can sign up for an ownCloud Proxy account with one of the supported providers. Once the account is confirmed, the ownCloud app initiates and maintains a secure connection to the ownCloud Proxy service. The service in turn provides a recognizable URL on the web that, when accessed via ownCloud clients, connects users back to their ownCloud server residing behind their router on a network at home or at work. Once the server is connected, simply download the desktop sync client from ownCloud.org, or get the ownCloud apps from the Apple App Store or Google Play, and get started.</p>

        <h2>Questions and answers</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
        <h3>How about security?</h3>
        <p>All of the security associated with ownCloud is at work when you use the ownCloud Proxy service. ownCloud is still run by you, on your computer. You can monitor what is happening, manage accounts, check the logs, use your own SSL certificates, enable automatic updates and more. The appliance pre-configures much of ownCloud for you. All you have to do is start the appliance, complete the setup and log into the web URL it provides. The ownCloud browser wizard at the provided URL will step you through logging in for the first time. Of course, as you configure accounts for others to share on your ownCloud, we recommend you use secure and complex passwords for all accounts.</p>
        <p>However, we want to be completely transparent about the nature of ownCloud Proxy. The ownCloud Proxy app is distributed and the source code is in the ownCloud repository for review in Github. The ownCloud Proxy service is provided by PageKite. All files transferred through the ownCloud Proxy service do pass through its data centers, and for a brief time are readable as the ownCloud Proxy service transfers incoming requests from SSL to <a href="https://pagekite.net/wiki/Floss/PageKiteProtocol/">a pageKite protocol</a> on the way to the private ownCloud Server. In theory, if someone wanted to, all files transferred to and from devices using the ownCloud Proxy service could – for that brief instant of time that they are being moved from the SSL terminated connection to the tunnel in memory – be read by someone with ownCloud Proxy service server access. While the risk is small, and our terms and conditions cover this situation, it is something we wanted to be clear about. However, there is no way for the ownCloud Proxy service to access your data on your private server, it can only broker a connection with your private server.</p>

        <div class="col-md-12">
        <h3>How are ownCloud Proxy and the ownCloud Server Appliance different than ownCloud?</h3>
        <p>The ownCloud Server appliance contains the ownCloud server, an OS and a database, provided in a pre-configured, easy to download, fast to set up package. ownCloud Proxy is an app inside the ownCloud appliance that enables an admin to sign up for and manage use of the ownCloud Proxy Service. This service is simply a connection broker that connects users outside of a network firewall to an ownCloud instance behind the firewall, with no special configuration required.</p>
        <p>Of course, if you already have ownCloud 8.1 up and running, the ownCloud Proxy app is available in <a href="https://marketplace.owncloud.com/content/show.php?content=173903">the ownCloud app store</a> and can be installed easily in an existing ownCloud instance to achieve the same overall result.</p>

        <h3>What if I Want to Disconnect my ownCloud Proxy Account?</h3>
        <p>If, at any time, you want to stop using ownCloud Proxy, simply use the stop button in the GUI and then disable the app in the ownCloud admin interface and it will stop working permanently.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
        <h3>Does ownCloud Proxy work with ownCloud Standard or Enterprise Subscriptions?</h3>
        <p>No, the ownCloud Proxy app and service are not designed to work with ownCloud subscriptions. The service architecture and bandwidth is intended for smaller ownCloud instances and sized accordingly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
        <h3>What if I want to dig a little deeper?</h3>
        <p>While we provide ownCloud Proxy and the ownCloud appliance to get you up and running fast, it is in no way limited. If you want to start configuring the components in the appliance for your use case, feel free. If you want to tune the database, or set up your own static IP address and domain name, and disable ownCloud connect? Go for it! And, for a real challenge, why not try an app from apps.owncloud.com, or write your own? ownCloud chat, ownCloud maps, ownCloud video streaming, ownCloud audio streaming – these are all apps built by the community. With ownCloud, the possibilities to explore are endless.</p>
