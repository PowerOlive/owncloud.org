=================================

- Risk: Medium
- CVSS v3 Base Score: 6.4
- CVSS v3 Vector: AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
- CWE ID: 79
- CWE Name: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')

Description
-----------
Due to a recent migration of the Gallery app to the new sharing endpoint a parameter changed from an integer to a string value. This value wasn't sanitized before and was thus now vulnerable to a Cross-Site-Scripting attack.To exploit this vulnerability an authenticated attacker has to share a folder with someone else, get them to open the shared folder in the Gallery app and open the sharing window there.Since ownCloud employs a strict Content-Security-Policy this vulnerability is only exploitable in browsers not supporting Content-Security-Policy. You can check at caniuse.com whether your browser supports CSP.

ownCloud Server <  9.0.4 (CVE-2016-????)

Action Taken
-------------
The user input is now properly sanitised before being provided back to the user.
