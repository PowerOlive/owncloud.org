The external storage functionality as implemented in ownCloud 9.0.x before 9.0.2 is improperly setting up external storages when multiple groups have been granted access to an external storage and a user is member of both groups.The storage class is setup without any setup information, leading to multiple issues, including:Unavailability of the external storageAccess to files that are not supposed to be shared (only if the 'Local' storage type is used)

ownCloud Server <  9.0.2 (CVE-2016-xxxx)

Action Taken
-------------
The storage code has been reviewed and been patched to properly setup the storage. Furthermore several hardenings have been added to ownCloud which will highly reduce the chance of a successful exploitation of similar vulnerabilities in the future.
