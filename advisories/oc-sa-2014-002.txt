Insecure OpenID implementation
==============================

- Risk: High
Description
-----------
Due to an insecure OpenID implementation used by user_openid in ownCloud 5 it is possible to log-into a system using an arbitrary OpenID Account (without knowing any secret information, i.e. the password, about it) by using a malicious OpenID provider.

ownCloud Server <  5.0.15 (CVE-2014-2048)

Action Taken
-------------
<p>As the application is not longer maintained anymore, user_openid has been removed from the release.</p>
