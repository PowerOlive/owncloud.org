Auth bypass in index.php
========================

- Risk: High
Description
-----------
ownCloud 4.0.6 and all versions previous to this doesn't sufficiently verify whether a request to appconfig.php was sent by an admin, which allows remote authenticated users to edit app configurations.NOTE: this can be leveraged by unauthenticated remote attackers using CVE-2012-4393.

ownCloud Server <  4.0.6 (CVE-2012-4752)
