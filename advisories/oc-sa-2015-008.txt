Command injection when using external SMB storage
=================================================

- Risk: High
- CVSS v2 Base Score: 9
- CVSS v2 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C
- CWE ID: 78
- CWE Name: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')

Description
-----------
The external SMB storage of ownCloud was not properly neutralizing all special elements which allows an adversary to execute arbitrary SMB commands.This was caused by improperly sanitizing the ; character which is interpreted as command separator by smbclient (the used software to connect to SMB shared by ownCloud)Effectively this allows an attacker to gain access to any file on the system or overwrite it, finally leading to a PHP code execution in the case of ownCloud's config file.

ownCloud Server <  6.0.8 (CVE-2015-4718)
ownCloud Server <  7.0.6 (CVE-2015-4718)
ownCloud Server <  8.0.4 (CVE-2015-4718)

Action Taken
-------------
<p>Files containing a <code>;</code> are no longer processed on external SMB storages. This is no regression as handling files containing said character was not reliably possible before as well.</p><p>ownCloud 8.1 will feature a completely rewritten SMB storage with cleaner code to reduce the attack surface even more.</p>
