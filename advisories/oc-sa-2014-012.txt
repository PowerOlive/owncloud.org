ownCloud Server <  6.0.3 (CVE-2014-3835)
ownCloud Server <  5.0.16 (CVE-2014-3835)

Action Taken
-------------
<p>We reviewed the access-control of the files_external application and ensured that permissions are checked properly for every action.</p><p>Additionally our next major release ownCloud 7 will give administrators the possibility to define which external storage type an user is allowed to mount.</p>
