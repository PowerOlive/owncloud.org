Description
-----------
The 'Import root certificate' ability that users are able to use once files_external is enabled allows users to import their own root certificates for connections. (e.g. server-to-server shares to servers using a self-signed certificate or external storages)The functionality was using the PHP OpenSSL parsing functions for parsing these certificate files. Namely, `openssl_pkey_get_public` and `openssl_x509_parse`. It turned out that these internally call `php_openssl_x509_from_zval` which allow passing in a file:///Therefore an attacker could pass a file beginning with `file://` and ownCloud would try to parse the corresponding file. This leads to a disclosure of arbitrary certificate files if the adversary can guess the correct path.

ownCloud Server <  7.0.14 (CVE-2016-xxxx)
ownCloud Server <  8.0.12 (CVE-2016-xxxx)
ownCloud Server <  8.1.7 (CVE-2016-xxxx)
ownCloud Server <  8.2.4 (CVE-2016-xxxx)
ownCloud Server <  9.0.2 (CVE-2016-xxxx)

Action Taken
-------------
ownCloud is now preventing files that being with 'file://' from being parsed.
