Timing attack on the password reset
===================================

- Risk: Medium
Description
-----------
The "Lost Password" implementation is vulnerable to a Remote Timing Attack. The token used to secure the password reset is fetched from the database and compared to the user-specified value using the equals operator. An attacker successfully rebuilding the token can then specify an arbitrary password in POST which will overwrite the old password.Please note that actual exploitation would require an attacker to be on the same LAN as the ownCloud server.

ownCloud Server <  4.5.1 (CVE-2012-5607)
ownCloud Server <  4.0.9 (CVE-2012-5607)
