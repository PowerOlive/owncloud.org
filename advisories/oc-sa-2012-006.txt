Auth bypass in user_webdavauth and user_ldap
============================================

- Risk: High
Description
-----------
ownCloud 4.5.4, ownCloud 4.0.9 and all versions previous to this doesn't sufficiently verify whether a request to settings.php was sent by an admin, which allows unauthenticated users to edit app configurations of user_webdavauth and user_ldap. An unauthenticated attacker may use this to gain access to any user account on the server if these plugins are enabled.

ownCloud Server <  4.0.10 (CVE-2013-5665)
ownCloud Server <  4.5.5 (CVE-2013-5665)
