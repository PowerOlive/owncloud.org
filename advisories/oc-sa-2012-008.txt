Insufficiently random values
============================

- Risk: Low
Description
-----------
The rand and mt_rand functions in PHP < 5.4.x do not produce cryptographically strong random numbers, which allows attackers to leverage exposures in products that rely on these functions for security-relevant functionality, as demonstrated by the password-reset functionality in ownCloud 4.0.x.

ownCloud Server <  4.0.8 (CVE-2008-4107)
