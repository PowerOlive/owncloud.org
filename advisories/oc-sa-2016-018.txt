Description
-----------
The CardDAV image export functionality as implemented in ownCloud allows the download of images stored within a vCard. Due to not performing any kind of verification on the image content this is prone to a stored Cross-Site Scripting attack.Note:ownCloud employs a very strict Content Security Policy on the DAV endpoints. This is thus only exploitable on browsers that don't support Content Security Policy.

ownCloud Server <  9.1.2 (CVE-2016-????)
ownCloud Server <  9.0.6 (CVE-2016-????)

Action Taken
