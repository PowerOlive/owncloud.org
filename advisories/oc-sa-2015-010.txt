Stored XSS in "activity" application
====================================

- Risk: Low
- CVSS v2 Base Score: 3.5
- CVSS v2 Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N
- CWE ID: 97
- CWE Name: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation

Description
-----------
Due to not sanitising all user provided input, the "activity" application shipped with the mentioned ownCloud versions is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting attacks. The "activity" application is enabled by default in the ownCloud Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.Successful exploitation requires that the adversary is able to create files containing the &quot; character. This character is forbidden by default in any current ownCloud version except 8.1.0 RC1, thus an actual exploitation requires that the user has mounted an external storage within ownCloud where a user can create files with such characters. Alternatively an adversary may discover a way to circumvent the input validation. (ownCloud is not aware of a bypass of to the input validation) - Furthermore the attacker must be able to share a folder containing the files with malicious filename with the victim.Since ownCloud employs a strict Content-Security-Policy that forbids inline script execution. Thus this bug is unlikely to be exploitable on recent browsers that support Content-Security-Policy. (Firefox &gt;= 23, Chrome &gt;= 25, Safari &gt;= 7)

ownCloud Server <  7.0.5 (CVE-2015-5953)
